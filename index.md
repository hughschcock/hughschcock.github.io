# Hello!

My name is **Alex**, and I recently discovered that I want to be a **<s>wizard</s>** programmer/developer.<br>
This is where I keep the stuff I am working on.<br>
I am currently trying to enroll in school because I want to take this a little more seriously.<br>
However I have taken a few courses on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) and [Youtube](https://youtube.com), <br>
and I like to read a programming e-book now and then.
I have some experience with:
  - <s>Parsel</s> Python
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - PHP
  - R
  - C (learning)
  
I am a self-taught warlock. Now and then I dabble with dark magic.
